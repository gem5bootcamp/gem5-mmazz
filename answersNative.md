- Question 1: Is more or less the same ass we can see in the data.
- Question 2:
    - a) No, we can see that its almost the same until we reach 16 threads, that the performance drops.
    - b) For only one thread the average time for algorithm 6 is 1.38, so the speedup: is on the table

- Question 3:
    - a)The most important optimization is adding padding between the result addresses.
    This is evident in Algorithm 5, where it consistently shows the best performance across all runs.
    - b) The hardware optimization works by ensuring that all threads write to
    different locations in memory that are on separate cache lines.
    This approach prevents cache line contention and invalidation, as each thread
    operates on a distinct cache line, avoiding interference with others.

SpeedUp from 1 core to 16 with 16 threads:\
The value of algorithm 1 is:  0.088\
The value of algorithm 2 is:  0.089\

The value of algorithm 4 is:  0.118\
The value of algorithm 5 is:  0.559\
The value of algorithm 6 is:  2.816\

- Question 4:
    - a) The speed up is 2.816.
    - b) Is similar, excepts that here the algorithm 2 is similar to 1 and not to algorithms 3 and 4 like in the real hardware.
- Question 5:
    - a) In this case the biggest impact was chunking.
        This can be seen in the comparison of 1 and 2, and
- Question 6:
    - The algorithms that reduce read shearing are the ones that use chunk arrays, this
    can be seen in the table, with algorithms 2,4 and 6, that use this technique.
    This happens because in those algorithms that don't use chunking, one core
    brings the line from memory and all others cores access addresses in that line.
- Question 7:
    - the algorithms that reduce writing shearing are the ones that use padding in the result.
    This can be seen in the table, with algorithms 5 and 6.
    This happens because now all cores are not writing in the same lines.
- Question 8:
    - a) the most important hardware characteristic is write sharing, we can see this because
    the biggest drop in time is in algorithm 5 and 6 which are those that significantly reduce
    write sharing.
    - b) The hardware reason why write shearing is the most important factor when optimizing, is because
        the protocol used, MESI, make it that when a core writes a line, this entired line gets invalidated
        in all other cores, so every core needs to mantein coherence every time it writes.
        Meanwhile, the fact that MESI allows for core to core shearing of addresses when read, mitigates the performance
        loss from cache misses.
